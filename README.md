The **M.E.V. Sandwich Bot** is a tool for **automated profit generation** on blockchains, leveraging sandwich attacks and other arbitrage strategies. It analyzes unconfirmed transactions in the mempool, generating profit by influencing token prices.

  

#### 🎯 How It Works

  

-  **Front.-running**: The bot places its transaction before a large user transaction.

-  **Victim’s Transaction**: The user’s main transaction goes through at an altered price.

-  **Back-running**: The bot sells tokens at the new price to capture profit.

  

#### 💡 Key Benefits

  

-  **Efficient unconfirmed transaction scanning**: The bot detects profitable transactions in real-time.

-  **Liquidity filtering and scam protection**: Built-in filters avoid low-liquidity or suspicious tokens by using contract audits, e.g., through Scansniffer.
