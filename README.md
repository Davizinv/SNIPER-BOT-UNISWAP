About
A modular, production-grade MEV bot built to scan Ethereum-like mempools, detect execution opportunities, and place optimized transactions on Uniswap pools. It includes modular strategy handlers, a wallet manager, on-chain tracing, and an execution engine. The code targets EVM-compatible chains and exposes a rich configuration system for gas, slippage, simulation, and trade splitting.

Key features
- Mempool scanner: monitors pending pool activity and identifies candidate transactions.
- Sandwich strategy: constructs front-run and back-run legs with dynamic sizing.
- Backrun and arbitrage modules: supports pair arbitrage, cross-pool arbitrage, and flash-arb flows.
- Execution engine: supports raw transactions, private relays, and direct RPC submission.
- Gas optimizer: gas-price estimation, EIP-1559 support, and dynamic tip control.
- Simulation suite: run on a local fork to validate every candidate trade.
- Config-driven: YAML/JSON config, per-strategy settings, and runtime overrides.
- Metrics and logs: Prometheus metrics, structured JSON logs, and persistent traces.
- Multi-network: works with mainnet and testnets, and custom RPC endpoints.
- Extensible: plugin hooks for strategy authors and custom swapping logic.

How it works
The bot runs a loop with three core parts:
1. Watcher: listens to a mempool stream or polls pending transactions. It filters for swaps relevant to configured token pairs and pools.
2. Analyzer: simulates candidate strategies on a local fork or by running static checks. It scores opportunities and checks gas feasibility.
3. Executor: builds signed transactions for each leg, sets gas parameters, and submits through the chosen path.

The bot uses a simulation-first approach. It runs full execution traces on a forked state to compute expected profit after liquidity impact, gas cost, and slippage. If the net outcome meets a configured threshold, the executor builds two or more signed transactions, orders them to achieve the intended outcome, and submits them through RPC or a private relay.

Architecture
- Core
  - runner: orchestrates watchers and executors.
  - scheduler: manages concurrency, retry, and cooldowns.
- Watchers
  - mempool-watcher: captures pending transactions.
  - rpc-poll-watcher: polls pending txs when mempool stream is unavailable.
- Strategy modules
  - sandwich: front-run/back-run pair with size calculator and slippage model.
  - arbitrage: finds price divergence across pools.
  - snipe: watches for price-impact trades and places a sniping order.
- Execution
  - signer: wallet abstraction with nonce manager and chain handling.
  - submitter: supports public RPC, batch RPC, and private relays like Flashbots.
- Simulation
  - fork-engine: spins a local fork for stateful simulation.
  - trace-engine: runs EVM traces to compute expected outcomes.
- Observability
  - metrics: Prometheus export.
  - logs: JSON structured logs with levels.
  - traces: saved traces per opportunity for later analysis.

Supported networks
- Ethereum mainnet (eth)
- Arbitrum
- Optimism
- Polygon
- Any EVM-compatible chain with a compatible RPC

Strategy modules
Sandwich strategy
Flow:
1. Identify a pending swap with material price impact on a target pool.
2. Simulate front-run leg: place a buy/sell to move price to a level that increases profit in back-run.
3. Simulate victim trade impact.
4. Simulate back-run leg: unwind position to capture spread.
5. Score the sequence for net profit after gas.

Sizing
The bot computes the optimal sandwich size by simulating multiple sizes and selecting the size that maximizes expected profit minus gas and slippage. The sizing engine uses pool reserves, constant product curve math (x*y=k), and expected victim gas and slippage.

Slippage handling
Set tight slippage on the front leg to prevent excessive MEV loss. Set a more flexible slippage on the back leg to ensure unwind success. The config exposes separate slippage controls per leg.

Arbitrage strategy
- Detect price differences between Uniswap pools or between Uniswap and other AMMs.
- Compute the minimal cycle that yields profit after fees.
- Execute the arbitrage through a single atomic transaction if possible.

Snipe strategy
- Target large incoming buys that will raise the price.
- Place a pre-funded buy with a gas tip optimized to get included before the target trade.
- Unwind after target trade completes.

Gas and priority management
Gas model
- Support legacy gasPrice and EIP-1559 (baseFee + maxPriorityFee + maxFee).
- Query the chain for current baseFee and recommend maxPriorityFee.
- Maintain a dynamic tip cap per strategy to avoid overbidding.

Nonce manager
- Local monotonic nonce manager prevents collisions when sending multiple transactions.
- Supports replacement and cancel flows.

Private relays
- Integrate with private submission channels to reduce slippage and sandwich competition.
- Use authenticated channels if supported.

Backoff and retries
- Exponential backoff for RPC errors.
- Retry on nonce issues after re-sync.

Simulation and testing
Local fork
- The bot provides scripts to launch a local fork with block number snapshot and RPC.
- Use the fork for full simulation of candidate sequences.

Test cases
- A set of saved mempool snapshots and victim transactions for regression testing.
- Unit tests for math, sizing, and gas calculations.

Fuzzing
- Strategy fuzzing harness to test edge cases across token decimals and extreme liquidity regimes.

Smart contract components
Signer and helper contracts
- The repo contains small Solidity helpers that allow atomic multi-leg execution when needed.
- Example helper: an executor contract that can receive funds and perform exact sequence on-chain in a single transaction.

Why helper contracts
- Reduce partial failure risk.
- Allow atomic execution when the private relay or flash loan is required.
- Provide gas refund patterns where supported.

ABI and interfaces
- The README includes ABI links and example contract addresses in the release notes.
- Always use verified contract artifacts from the release.

Monitoring and telemetry
Metrics
- Prometheus metrics: opportunities scanned, accepted, executed, profit_usd, gas_spent.
- Histogram of strategy execution times.

Logs
- Structured JSON logs include timestamps, strategy name, candidate id, expected_profit_usd, gas_cost, and tx hashes.
- Log levels: debug, info, warn, error.

Traces
- For each accepted opportunity, the bot saves the simulation trace to disk. These traces store the full EVM trace and state delta for later analysis.

Dashboards
- Example Grafana dashboard bundles ship with the release asset to visualize key metrics.

Security practices
Wallet isolation
- Use a dedicated wallet with limited funds.
- Use hardware wallets when possible for high-value deployments.

Key rotation
- Support for rotating keys and short-lived keys in the wallet manager.

RPC hygiene
- Use authenticated RPC endpoints for higher throughput.
- Configure a set of redundant RPC providers.

Simulation-first flow
- Run a full simulation before signing a transaction.
- Compare simulated outcomes against current chain state before submission.

Access control
- If you expose a control API, restrict it to authorized hosts and require API keys.

Performance tuning
Mempool ingestion
- Use websocket-based mempool feeds for lowest latency.
- Fallback to RPC polling if websockets fail.

Concurrency
- Limit concurrency to the number of parallel nonces the wallet can safely manage.
- Adjust worker counts based on CPU and RPC throughput.

Batching
- Batch remote calls like balance queries to reduce RPC overhead.

Memory and disk
- Offload old traces after X days to cold storage.

Deployment patterns
Single-node
- Start with a single node for testing. Use simulation mode until behavior stabilizes.

Clustered
- For high throughput, run multiple workers behind a shared nonce manager and Redis-based queue. Ensure unique wallet per worker or a robust shared nonce protocol.

Docker
- The project ships a Docker image for consistent deployments. Use an environment file to pass sensitive settings.

Systemd
- Provide a systemd unit file example to run the bot as a service.

Example systemd unit
```ini
